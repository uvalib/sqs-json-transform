One of THL's central foci has been the creation and creative dissemination of audio-video collections with the goal of documenting oral and embodied forms of knowledge in Tibet and the Himalayas, as well as helping facilitate self-representation by residents of the region. THL both creates original audio-video recordings, and helps disseminate the films of others. All items are dynamically linked to geographical maps as well as to knowledge maps of cultural subjects. Read more about THL or explore THL beyond the audio-video collections.\n","caption":[" "],"creator_role_ss":[],"creator":"David Germano","mogrified_s":"true","collection_visibility_s":"public","subcollection_id_is":["1721","1725","1748","1760","2228","2258","3498","3939","4835","4836","5586","5591","5596","5911","7971","9531","12281","13481","16526","17076","20761","25416","25421","26211","26331","36736","39796","39926","41466"],"subcollection_private_id_is":["1769","5059","35846","41756"],"subcollection_uid_ss":["audio-video-collection-1721","audio-video-collection-1725","audio-video-collection-1748","audio-video-collection-1760","audio-video-collection-2228","audio-video-collection-2258","audio-video-collection-3498","audio-video-collection-3939","audio-video-collection-4835","audio-video-collection-4836","audio-video-collection-5586","audio-video-collection-5591","audio-video-collection-5596","audio-video-collection-5911","audio-video-collection-7971","audio-video-collection-9531","audio-video-collection-12281","audio-video-collection-13481","audio-video-collection-16526","audio-video-collection-17076","audio-video-collection-20761","audio-video-collection-25416","audio-video-collection-25421","audio-video-collection-26211","audio-video-collection-26331","audio-video-collection-36736","audio-video-collection-39796","audio-video-collection-39926","audio-video-collection-41466"],"subcollection_idfacet_ss":["Qinghai Monasteries Project|audio-video-collection-1721","Xunhua Tibetan Folk Culture Series|audio-video-collection-1725","Kham Collection|audio-video-collection-1748","Amdo Collection|audio-video-collection-1760","Repgong Folktale Project|audio-video-collection-2228","Nomadic Folk Songs from Sichuan Project|audio-video-collection-2258","Oral Cultures of Bhutan|audio-video-collection-3498","Repgong Folk Songs Project|audio-video-collection-3939","Hoefer Films|audio-video-collection-4835","Proverbs from Nomadic Areas of Sichuan|audio-video-collection-4836","Gangsol Nomadic Oral Folk Traditions|audio-video-collection-5586","Gabu Village Cham|audio-video-collection-5591","Ngawa Folk Songs|audio-video-collection-5596","Foods of Amdo|audio-video-collection-5911","Riddles of Bayan and Chentsa|audio-video-collection-7971","Ngawa Tamshe and Lingrab|audio-video-collection-9531","Ursula Graham Bower |audio-video-collection-12281","Ngawa Traditional Crafts|audio-video-collection-13481","Nomadic Folk Traditions from Tsekhok|audio-video-collection-16526","Amdo Tserig|audio-video-collection-17076","Folktales from Tsolho|audio-video-collection-20761","Traditional Education of Tibetan Children in Zangkar|audio-video-collection-25416","Circle Dances of Golok|audio-video-collection-25421","Children's Songs Concert|audio-video-collection-26211","Larung Gar Audio Collection|audio-video-collection-26331","Oral Culture of Jon\u00e9|audio-video-collection-36736","Traditional Speeches from Amdo|audio-video-collection-39796","Luru Festival in Repgong Mepa|audio-video-collection-39926","Gyelrong Folk Songs|audio-video-collection-41466"],"subcollection_name_ss":["Qinghai Monasteries Project","Xunhua Tibetan Folk Culture Series","Kham Collection","Amdo Collection","Repgong Folktale Project","Nomadic Folk Songs from Sichuan Project","Oral Cultures of Bhutan","Repgong Folk Songs Project","Hoefer Films","Proverbs from Nomadic Areas of Sichuan","Gangsol Nomadic Oral Folk Traditions","Gabu Village Cham","Ngawa Folk Songs","Foods of Amdo","Riddles of Bayan and Chentsa","Ngawa Tamshe and Lingrab","Ursula Graham Bower ","Ngawa Traditional Crafts","Nomadic Folk Traditions from Tsekhok","Amdo Tserig","Folktales from Tsolho","Traditional Education of Tibetan Children in Zangkar","Circle Dances of Golok","Children's Songs Concert","Larung Gar Audio Collection","Oral Culture of Jon\u00e9","Traditional Speeches from Amdo","Luru Festival in Repgong Mepa","Gyelrong Folk Songs"],"collection_type_s":"collection","members_id_ss":["edwardgarrett","dfg9w","snw8f","eg15","ba5v","tw4aa","kg5ua","vck6mg","mf8yk","ndg8f","fz2k","am5kh","ms4qm","emy4rg","lg6dn"],"members_uid_ss":["user-3","user-4","user-11","user-14","user-17","user-27","user-30","user-69","user-103","user-105","user-148","user-221","user-586","user-601","user-7056"],"members_name_ss":["Edward Garrett","David Germano","Steve Weinberger","Eddie John","Bradley Aaron","Tsehua Washu","Kalwangjyid Gejay","Veronica Kuhn","Mark Ferrara","Than Grove","Tashi Dekyid Gar","Ariana Maki","Michael Sheehy","Eben Yonnetti","Lugyal Gerster"],"url_thumb_width":"500","url_thumb_height":"375","url_thumb_size":"44515","projects_ss":["tibet"],"title_sort_s":"Tibetan and Himalayan Library","creator_sort_s":"David Germano","date_start":"0000-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
